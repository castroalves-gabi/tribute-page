      <p id="tribute-info">Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, better known as Mahatma Gandhi, was a key figure in the Indian independence movement through his philosophy of nonviolent civil disobedience. Here are some of his major accomplishments in chronological order:

  <h2>1. Civil Rights Activism in South Africa (1893-1914)</h2>
  <p>Early in his career, Gandhi fought against racial discrimination in South Africa, advocating for the rights of Indians living there. His experiences in South Africa would later shape his approach to nonviolent resistance.</p>

  <h2>2. Champaran and Kheda Satyagraha (1917-1918)</h2>
  <p>Gandhi launched his first major satyagraha (nonviolent resistance) campaigns in Champaran and Kheda, addressing issues such as indigo farmers' exploitation and oppressive taxation policies, respectively.</p>

  <h2>3. Non-Cooperation Movement (1920-1922)</h2>
  <p>Gandhi called for non-cooperation with British authorities, urging Indians to boycott British goods and institutions. This marked a significant shift in the struggle for independence.</p>

  <h2>4. Salt March (1930)</h2>
  <p>In protest of the British monopoly on salt, Gandhi led a 240-mile march to the Arabian Sea, where he and his followers produced salt by evaporating seawater. The Salt March became a symbol of nonviolent resistance.</p>

  <h2>5. Quit India Movement (1942)</h2>
  <p>Gandhi launched the Quit India Movement, demanding an end to British rule. The movement played a crucial role in the eventual withdrawal of British colonial forces from India.</p>

  <h2>6. Independence and Partition (1947)</h2>
  <p>India gained independence in 1947, but the joy was marred by the partition that created India and Pakistan. Gandhi worked tirelessly to promote peace and unity during this tumultuous period.</p></p>
